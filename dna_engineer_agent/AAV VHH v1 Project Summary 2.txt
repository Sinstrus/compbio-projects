AAV VHH Display Project: Design Document v1.0Date: December 09, 2025Status: Draft / ActionableContext: Voyager Therapeutics / IPD CollaborationPriority: High (PoC Triage)1. Executive SummaryThis document outlines the Phase I "Sprint" to validatethe surface display of VHH (Nanobodies) on AAV capsids (AAV9 serotype). The primary objective is to demonstrate functional display and redirected tropism using a Mosaic Capsid strategy before moving to complex library generation.We are testing two distinct architectural hypotheses:VP2 N-Terminus Fusion: Historically safer for assembly but limited avidity (~5 copies/capsid).VP1 Surface Loop Insertion (VR-IV & VR-VIII): Higher risk of assembly failure but higher potential avidity and better solvent exposure. We will implement "Biogen-style" linker designs (Flexible vs. Coiled-Coil) to mitigate structural instability.2. Phase I: DNA Construction (The "Build" List)We require two sets of plasmids to test the structural hypotheses. These will be used in a trans complementation assay (Mosaic Production).Architecture A: VP2 N-Terminus FusionRationale: The N-terminus of VP2 is non-essential for assembly and can tolerate large insertions. However, it is often buried; functionality requires externalization.Plasmid IDNameGenetic Logic & MutationsNotespA-01VP2-VHH-DonorBackbone: RepCap (p40 promoter)Insert: VHH fused to VP2 N-term (after residue 138).Silencing Mutations:1. VP1 KO: Start codon ATG $\rightarrow$ AAG (M1L).2. VP3 KO: Start codon ATG $\rightarrow$ TTG (M203L).AAP Status: Retain AAP (do not mutate).QC Check: Ensure VHH sequence does not contain internal Methionines that could act as spurious start sites for truncated VP3s.pA-02VP1+3 HelperBackbone: Standard RepCap.Silencing Mutation:1. VP2 KO: Start codon ACG $\rightarrow$ ACC (T138T silent).AAP Status: Retain AAP.This plasmid supplies the structural bulk (VP3) and infectivity machinery (VP1 PLA2 domain) without competing for the VP2 slot.Architecture B: VP1 Surface Loop Insertion (VR-IV & VR-VIII)Rationale: Inserting into the variable loops (spikes) offers optimal receptor engagement. We will test two specific linker designs derived from patent literature to ensure stability.Plasmid IDNameGenetic Logic & MutationsDesign Specs (Ref: Source 261/349)pB-01VP1-VHH (VR-IV Flexible)Backbone: RepCap.Silencing: VP2 KO (ACG$\rightarrow$ACC) & VP3 KO (ATG$\rightarrow$TTG).Locus: VR-IV (Loop IV).Design D2 (Asymmetric):- Deletion: $\Delta$455-456- Linker 1 (N-term): (GGGGS)4- Linker 2 (C-term): None/ShortHypothesis: Best for high-affinity clones.pB-02VP1-VHH (VR-VIII Coiled-Coil)Backbone: RepCap.Silencing: Same as pB-01 (Only make VP1).Locus: VR-VIII (Loop VIII).Design D7 (Zipper):- Deletion: $\Delta$589- Linker 1: Leading Coil (Seq 53)- Linker 2: Returning Coil (Seq 54)Hypothesis: Rescues stability at this difficult locus.pB-03VP2+3 HelperBackbone: Standard RepCap.Silencing:1. VP1 KO: ATG $\rightarrow$ AAG.Supplies the bulk capsid (VP3) and VP2. The modified VP1 (pB-01/02) is supplied in trans.3. Phase II: Proof-of-Concept Workflow (The "Test" Phase)Goal: Produce mosaic AAV particles and validate VHH function against a reporter target (e.g., ALPL or TfR1).3.1. Mosaic Production Protocol (Triple Transfection)To avoid steric hindrance, we will not produce 100% modified capsids. We will titrate the modified VP plasmid against the Helper VP plasmid.Plasmids:GOI Plasmid: scAAV-CBA-GFP (Self-complementary for fast readout).Adeno Helper: pAdDeltaF6.Cap Plasmid Mix:Condition A (VP2): pA-01 : pA-02 at ratios 1:5, 1:10, 1:20.Condition B (VP1 Loop): pB-01 : pB-03 at ratios 1:10, 1:20.3.2. Quality Control (QC)Before functional testing, we must verify physical incorporation.Western Blot: Use anti-VP1/2/3 antibody (B1 clone).Expectation: A "shifted" band corresponding to the VHH-fusion (approx +15kDa).Failure Mode: If only WT bands appear, the VHH-fusion was unstable or degraded.3.3. Functional AssayTarget Cells: HEK293 (or CHO) overexpressing the VHH target (e.g., TfR1).Readout: Flow cytometry for GFP+ cells at 48h.Control: WT AAV9 (should show low/background transduction).4. Phase III: Strategic Outlook (The "Library" Phase)While Phase I executes, we must solve the architectural bottlenecks for the high-throughput library phase.Q1: Solving the "Cis-Packaging" ProblemFor a pooled library, the gene encoding the VHH must be inside the particle it modifies. The Mosaic strategy (trans plasmids) breaks this linkage.Risk: Putting the VHH sequence inside the Cap gene (within the ITR) is difficult due to splicing constraints and size limits.Alternative: "Split" Barcoding / I53-50 Logic.Instead of encoding the VHH in the ITR, we barcode the ITR genome.We maintain a "One-Plasmid-Per-Cell" transfection limit.Constraint: This requires strict plasmid dilution to prevent cross-packaging (Phenotypic Mixing).Q2: Linker Strategy for LibrariesThe "Biogen" data suggests a trade-off:Flexible (D2): Better for high-affinity binders but risks conformational entropy.Coiled-Coil (D7): Better for lower-affinity binders (avidity) and stabilizing "difficult" loops.Decision: For the initial library, we should likely standardize on D2 (Flexible VR-IV) to minimize structural variables, unless Phase I shows D7 is strictly required for assembly.5. Immediate Action ItemsGene Synthesis: Order pA-01, pB-01, pB-02 immediately. Include NotI / AscI sites flanking the VHH insert for future library cloning.Mutagenesis: Perform SDM on existing AAV9 plasmid to create pA-02 and pB-03 (Helper plasmids).Reagent Check: Confirm stock of Anti-VP antibody (Clone B1) for Western Blot QC.
